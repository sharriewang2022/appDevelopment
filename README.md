# The Development of Financial Appï¼šWeFin
This design is around the process for the development of a financial balance app WeFin.
This app provides a bookkeeping tool that enables customers to document transactions like income and expenses and submit them to different accounts so that they can handle payments and carry out regular banking tasks. 

This app is developed by applying Microsoft's Blazor Hybrid with.NET MAUI software toolkit to an operating system running Windows. Blazor is a free and open-source web framework that enables developers to create web apps using C# and HTML, which is being developed by Microsoft. NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) could build native apps using a .NET cross-platform UI toolkit that targets the mobile and desktop form factors on Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and Tizen. Blazor Hybrid integrates native.NET MAUI together with web-based technologies like CSS, HTML, and JavaScript; Therefore, this app could run on the Web, desktop, and mobile devices via a set of tools that MAUI offers. 

 The core functions of this app are the following:
1) Logging in 
2) editing financial bills
3) searching bills
4) generating journal reports
5) generating ledger reports
6) Register users

This app makes use of the SQLite database. All of the data entered by users, including login detail and bill information, is stored in a database.
